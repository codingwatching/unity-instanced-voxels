At the moment, this repository contains only the code that I'm describing in my [series of articles](https://utkaka.github.io/blog/2023/09/28/voxel-rendering-in-unity-part-1.html) about working with voxels in Unity. Once the articles are completed, there will be a more or less functional solution for mesh voxelization and rendering. Perhaps later, I will even create a full-fledged Unity Package here.
